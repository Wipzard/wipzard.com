#UK unblocked services:

### For unblocking UK services instead of using usual ProxyDNS servers (74.207.242.213 and 50.116.28.138) you must use these:

### 88.80.186.67 
### 162.243.65.31 

###And then you will be able to access:

# [UK Netflix](http://netflix.com/) 
# [UK Spotify](http://spotify.com/)
# [BBC iPlayer*](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/) 
# [itv.com](http://itv.com)
# [__you tell us!__](http://support.proxydns.co/)

### * BBC iPlayer also gets unblocked with usual ProxyDNS servers (74.207.242.213 and 50.116.28.138)

 Why this? 

 In case you are wondering why do you have to change DNS settings for unblocking UK services, instead of using "control panels" like other competing services, it is because in order to maintain max performance by not making "user related checks" in the DNS service itself (like checking user country preferences or if the user is free or premium, etc), **it makes ProxyDNS service a lot faster than the rest**, but requires you to change the settings like its described in this page when you want to use UK services instead.
