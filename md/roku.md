#roku (LT, HD, 2 XD, 3) setup:

###ProxyDNS was initially created focused on Roku, a device that doesn't allow any Network Configuration, so all the config must be made on the wifi router of your network.

# Remember to create your Roku account using ProxyDNS and define a USA address in it, so you can successfully unlock the services in your Roku.

###In order to make it work, please refer to: *[Routers Setup](/setup/)*
